## Execution

The topic of this cheat sheet is _Helpful HTML Tags_. Two categories are tabulated and explained: _Page Setup and Section Elements_ and _Lists_.

A table of opening tags, closing tags and notes is provided under each category. Any tags displayed are formatted differently per the specification above.

A background image is employed for the page as well as a banner-style background image for the header. Section headers, table formatting, etc... is presented with a coherent color scheme.
